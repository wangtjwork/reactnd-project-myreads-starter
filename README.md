# MyReads Project

A React-based easy to maintain website. This site tracks the books a user has read and shows the status of them.

## Installation

`git clone` the project and then:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Instructions

Main page is for showing the books the user chose. Three categories: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read. The user could move a book to any one of the categories by clicking on the lower-right corner of each picture of book, and choose the category.

To delete a book, simply choose 'None' when selecting categories. User can add it back on the search page later.

The user is also able to add new books by clicking on the plus icon located at the lower-right corner of the whole webpage and go to search page. By typing on the search input, some books will then appear and the user will move books the same way as if they are already chosen.

To go back to the main page, click on the back button on the upper-left corner of the page, or simply hit back on the browser.
